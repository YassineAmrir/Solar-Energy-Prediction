   - Used dropout layers (20%) to reduce overfitting.
   - Optimized hyperparameters like sequence length and learning rate.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   - Plotted actual vs. predicted results for visual comparison.

4. **Results**
   - GRU showed the best performance with an MSE of `0.01057`.
   - Transformer-based models demonstrated potential for longer dependencies but required more tuning.
